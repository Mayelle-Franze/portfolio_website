       <h3>Entering the world of design</h3>
          <p>I've always had the urge to be creative. Yet I come from a rather tech-savvy family background myself. However, I never knew how to combine that with a profession. Since I hadn't figured this out in my media studies and in my work at a music agency, I kept looking and came to UI / UX Design. Shortly after I decided to start studying in this field, I felt like I had finally found what I was looking for. The combination of design and problem solving seemed perfect for me. </p>
       <h3>For each problem several solutions</h3>
          <p>During the course I learned not only how to understand a project brief but also how to solve the issues at hand. User research, and the creation of personas which helps me determine who a product is being created for. The subsequent creation of user flows, wireframes, prototypes and testing all help to keep the big picture in mind and to constantly reformulate my actual ideas. In addition, I gained an understanding of how things like design patterns, typography and color can give a design a tone and emphasize its identity. Each time it's exciting for me to see how an initial idea turns into reality and how it really looks in the end after testing and polishing. </p>
      <h3>Learnings</h3>
          <p>I never thought that after such a short time I would develop so much and master programs like Adobe XD and Figma so well, even though there is still something new to discover here every day. Thanks to my previous job, I was also able to develop my skills in the programs Premiere Pro and After Effects. But since I had no idea who or what frontend is, how it works and how my designs are created in the end, I decided to take a specialization course in frontend development. This helped me to formulate my design decisions better and to work together with developers more effectively. </p>
